Maybe, just maybe, OK definitely, I don't have that much to write.
Or, just deploying this website and figuring it our has made me tired and I have no more energy to think.

Thank you! Now say "nuclear wessels"! No! Don't jump! A sexy mistake. Anyone who laughs is a communist!

A true inspiration for the children. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Moving along… Do a flip! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I bth rue and lament it.

![WTF](/assets/wall patterng.jpg "WTF")

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Then we'll go with that data file! **I've been there.** _My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants._ What am I, the pope?

Daddy Bender, we're hungry. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! We're rescuing ya. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.

I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! I never loved you. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!

1. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.
2. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."
3. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!

Bender, quit destroying the universe! No! The cat shelter's on to me. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Fatal. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.

I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? I don't want to be rescued.

- You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.
- And when we woke up, we had these bodies.
- Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!

Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. \$9.95 a minute. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

You mean while I'm sleeping in it? I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Negative, bossy meat creature!

Oh God, what have I done? I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

Ask her how her day was. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Why did you bring us here? I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!

Hello Morbo, how's the family? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.

My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.

You are the last hope of the universe. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

Hey, guess what you're accessories to. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Why would a robot need to drink? What are their names? Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!

I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Shinier than yours, meatbag. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?

Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.

Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.

That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Bender, we're trying our best. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! I just told you! **You've killed me!** _And yet you haven't said what I told you to say!_ How can any of us trust you?

## It doesn't look so shiny to me.

No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! It doesn't look so shiny to me. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Soon enough. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.

![]()

1. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
2. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
3. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!

### Daylight and everything.

A true inspiration for the children. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Can I use the gun? Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!

- Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!
- Look, last night was a mistake.
- Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!

And I'm his friend Jesus. One hundred dollars. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! No! The cat shelter's on to me.

Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. I'm Santa Claus! Leela's gonna kill me. Then we'll go with that data file!

That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Bite my shiny metal ass. Tell them I hate them. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Hey, whatcha watching? A sexy mistake. A true inspiration for the children. Shut up and get to the point!

Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. So, how 'bout them Knicks? Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.

Shut up and get to the point! Take me to your leader! I can explain. It's very valuable. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?

Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!

I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.

You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!

Fatal. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Really?! You can see how I lived before I met you. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.

Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.
