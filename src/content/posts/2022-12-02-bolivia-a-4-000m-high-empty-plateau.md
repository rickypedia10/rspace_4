I was finally beginning to enjoy riding in Argentina. Salta and the surrounding colored mountain region are so beautiful. But my plans to meet a friend in Bolivia and travel together meant I was on a tight schedule. Over the next 4 days, I rode a 1000km to La Paz. Easy enough, except for the gringo tax on gasoline (in hindsight, not that unfair. Even found a way around it on my 2nd visit and it became a fun game.)

I enjoyed my 2 weeks stay in La Paz. Well, I recovered from a stomach bug while waiting for the Peruvian visa. It's fascinating how the residents have expanded from the valley region below to build houses on the side of the mountains. Some streets are steep, and you can lose your breath easily while climbing. The city is at 4000masl. Even the motorcycle struggles on some routes when fully loaded. My favorite activity in LP was taking the cable car up to El Alto (the highest capital of the world) and visiting the local market there.

Visiting the Uyuni salt flat with M was a highlight of my trip. 200*200km of an empty dry salt lake. The vastness and emptiness are hard to explain in words. Distance perspectives become distorted completely, making objects seem much much much closer than they are. The mountains in the distance seem within touching distance, but you can travel for hours and they don't appear any closer. Life experience!

As we traveled together north back to La Paz, it was the first time riding 2-up fully loaded. The bike didn't give any problems thankfully, except for an almost worn-out clutch cable, and off we went to Per√∫, finishing part 1 of my time in Bolivia.

I knew I hadn't seen any of Bolivia, and 1 year later, I went back with a better plan and more time to explore. Starting again in La Paz (this time I stayed outside the city), I quickly continued south, passing through Oruro, Sucre, Potos√≠, Uyuni, Tupiza, and finally Tarija.

Sucre is so European, so hip. The region is lower than La Paz, so it's easier to walk around and the air is thicker. Good food. The road to Potos√≠ is so beautiful. Potos√≠ was the center of colonial mining activities. Back to Uyuni and this time I crossed the salt lake north to south. The empty region just south of Uyuni is so beautiful and except for some travelers and some transport trucks towards Chile, quite empty.Going down from Tupiza to Tarija, the weather gods decided to make it extremely difficult. Tarija received its first snowfall in almost 70 years. Yes, on the exact day when I was traveling there. 4 scary slippery hours of riding, thanks to Global Warming! Tarija is such a chill place btw, quite hip, underrated wine, and has good food.

From here, I went back up north towards Brazil, via Villamontes (surprisingly good fish!), Samaipata (surprisingly underrated), and Vallegrande (both hidden gems with good places around to explore), and towards Santa Cruz de la Sierra. This part of Bolivia is plain and has an altitude of just 500masl, starkly different from the high plateau. It's so close to Brazil, so I enjoyed some delicious Barbecue meals (all 3 days!).

The last 2 days were all about riding in a straight line for 8 hours, passing through some empty small towns and Amish communities in an otherwise deserted region. The only 'adventure' was bypassing the Bolivian customs to avoid paying the fine for overstayingü§´
