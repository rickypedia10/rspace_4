I knew Perú would be an adventure before entering. No idea it would be such an experience! I did have a love-hate relationship with this country when there, but in retrospect, it is my favourite country of the whole trip.

How can it not be? The scenery, diversity, colours, people, food, drink, smells, culture, markets, prices, everything was amazing! Adventurous riding during the day, nice places to eat and sleep in the evening, what more can you ask from a motorcycle trip? No wonder so many ADV riders flock here.

Just the 2nd day after entering from Bolivia was extreme. 360kms on a twisty highway between Puno and Cusco sounds normal. But when it started to snow midway with nowhere to stop, it became an intense experience, and after 200kms when the snow stopped, I just went to sleep in the first posada I could find.

Unexpected adventures became a theme in Perú, aided by my 0 sense of planning or gathering information.

After a month of relaxing (and working) in Cusco, with a visit to Machu Picchu, I headed towards Ica to catch a glimpse of Desafio Inca, the pre-Dakar rally. Wow. Watching the brave bikers jump around the dunes on their rally bikes, and later meeting them is a lifelong memory.

As I continued north, I passed through some amazing places like Paracas, Huaraz (Huascaran National park), Pallasca, Santiago de Chuco, Huamachuco, Cajamarca, and then onto Chachapoyas. Peruvian Andes have something mystic about them, rising and falling unexpectedly, the weather always unpredictable, roads and dirt tracks in such terrain almost geographically impossible. Thankfully, this makes the interior regions difficult to live in and visit for humans, keeping them pristine and beautiful.

Traveling from Chachapoyas down toward the beach, the bike's electronics decided to switch off.\
Luckily I was traveling downhill and slowly traveled down for the next 30kms to the next town. A truck took me the next 125kms to Jaén where the mechanic repaired what I never understood the problem was. This was the last adventure as I continued to the coast for 3 days of laying on a hammock on the beach before entering Ecuador.

I knew I would be back in Perú someday, I just didn't know it would be within 6 months. This time I entered from Ecuador via Vilcabamba, and I planned to have even more adventures (Thanks mak for the inspiration). The journey began obviously in Jaén as I got a much-needed TLC for the bike from my trusted mechanic.

Perú kept throwing new surprises on even the routes I had already been to, and I kept absorbing and enjoying them, knowing that THIS is why I came to South America!

This time, I visited new places like Caraz, San Marcos via the Punta Olimpica tunnel, Huanuco, Cerro de Pasco, Huancavelica, Ayacucho, and Quillabamba, before entering finally into Bolivia.

Thankfully there was no snow this time, but some memorable experiences like the Bull-fighting festival, high mountain passes and vast mining regions, ancient Incan ruins, and much more.

The highlight is the region of Cusco, especially Urubamba, where I stayed away from crowded touristy places and explored all around with the motorcycle. Didn't make it to the thermal waters in Lares, but the Incan food festival near Pisac made up for it.

I'll be back in Perú someday, and this time I wish for even crazier adventures! I find myself randomly opening the map and zooming into places I didn't visit before, looking at the pictures, and dreaming. I'm sure Perú will deliver on my expectations, and then some more!

PS: Such a long blog post and I didn't mention Lima even once. I was there a total of 4 different times and I adore the city.
