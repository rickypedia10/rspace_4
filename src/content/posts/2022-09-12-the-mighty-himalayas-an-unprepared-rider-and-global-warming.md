The butterflies in my stomach when I left were crazy. I was so nervous I was looking for (and did find) excuses not to leave the comfort of home. Boy am I glad that I did. It's nice. Really nice. Riding on the highway in the plains felt boring. But once I reached the mountains, it was fun.\
\
Thanks to some recommendations from fellow ADVers down south!\
I went upto Salooni and then turned towards J&K. Really nice route and finally found some off road that I was looking for. Being so densely populated, plus the army presence, most roads are well developed. Finding off road routes is much more difficult in India than I could have imagined. I was expecting more, but traveling is about acceptance, not expectations.

Some views reminded me of similar locations in Peru and Bolivia.

Day 3, I rode to Killar. Started at 6.30 am! (Early morning rides are THE BEST!)\
This is why I came here. Beautiful scenery and good off roading. Nothing too difficult, even buses and local cars pass here, nonetheless very exciting.

Killar is... Desolate? Small empty town high up the mountains. In the day was too hot , and the sun is strong here. Everything's closed. No fuel stations up here. (Reminds me of Bolivia) Beautiful mountains.

Too much trash. In India we love to live dirty. I am standing in a parking with a beautiful view of snowcapped mountains, and there are like 4 piles of trash, just plastic. Also, there was no power until about 10pm. I was worried my phone won't charge.

Am I just complaining?

On the positive side, life is chill here. There's some pureness to daily chores. Sunday is slow anyway. Some females are even wearing masks, that's unexpected and nice. Mostly men are visible in such places. How do I get tired climbing 2 flights of stairs and people climb dirt trails along the mountains like they're walking in a park.

Day 4: Beautiful route. And proud to be awake and off so early.!!!

I was so confused about what route to take from here. Afraid tbh. Maybe I'm just addicted to internet. Definitely one of the reasons. After checking the map a thousand times, I felt it won't be so difficult. Plus, I need to maintain my image among other overlander travelers.

Anyway I am in this small village called Darcha. Slightly off the main route. Such peace and calm here, nice people, especially in my homestay. Simple and pure life. La Dolce Vita.

Tomorrow I'm off to Zanskar. Would be lovely. But, you know, let's accept, not expect.

Pï»¿S: I don't like the other bikers. Not a surprise obviously. Idiot Hooligans on the Leh highway.\
\
Dï»¿ay 5 was all about perseverance. This route was difficult. The bike couldn't climb at all. Didn't adjust my carbs ðŸ˜‚ lesson learnt, or not? Steep slopes and the brakes were not in the best condition either. Some routes were legitimately scary. How many times did I want to just turn around. Glad I didn't. High mountain pass, followed by a steep decent (would be difficult on my way back), then turned into a wide open track along the canal. Some Yaks, some vehicles, some labourers building the roads, but mostly just vast emptiness.

![I later found out that this mountain pass is called Shingo La, and goes up to 5,091m.](/assets/pic3.jpg "I later found out that this mountain pass is called Shingo La, and goes up to 5,091m.")

Pï»¿adum is amazing too. Beautiful is to put it mildly. Just wowwww!!!!!!!

Glad I came here now, because 2 years later there would be a highway here, probably full of bikers. They're even planning a tunnel under the highest pass (16,500 ft.)

Day 6\
Long day of riding. Really hot. This is a full on desert in the mountains. So dry and the sun is scorching.\
Add to that the constant dust and dirt of construction vehicles. My clothes have never been this dirty after a ride. I can't even calculate how much dirt i have inhaled today.\
Oh, the glacier. Yeah it was ok. Not mesmerising. I guess the ice is melting. Meh. Atleast the bike worked good today.\
Tomorrow's route is not under construction, so hopefully it would be less dusty. No expectations though..\
\
Just did a full fledged yoga routine, feels awesome.\

Day 7\
Sometimes you take the L and move on. Chose your battles. Some sports quote like that.\
Morning ride was nice, but the climb just too steep for my bike. Okayish ride back. Wide open valley and good views of dry Rocky mountains.\
\
Good lunch and i slept like a baby for 3 hours. Chill evening and am gonna sleep. Tomorrow would be a long hard day till Darcha.\
\
Had a bad dinner. Could've eaten at a new place, but fear of the unknown made me chose the old one. And i regret that. Lesson: Embrace the unknown.\

Day 8\
If you're not armed well, the Himalayas will chew you up and spit you out.\
And i was armed with a blunt knife against an army with snipers. My overconfidence lead me to this route, and neither me nor my bike were fully ready for what was to happen.\
Left my hotel at 5:30am. Morning ride and climbs were okayish. Then came the climbs at Cha, which i failed at. Had some truckers push the bike up, and put the luggage in a Thar. Helpful people!!!!!\
This eased the ride a lot. But the heatwave played havoc to my route. Snow from the mountaintops started melting and almost flooded the valley below, creating deep water crossings on the soft terrain. The first crazy one, where a lot of other people coming the other way were stuck, was 2 stream, both knee deep with freezing water. Took me 1 hour to somehow get to the other side with 4 people helping me. Helpful people!!!!!!!\
(That biker group from WB with their interceptor and pulsar were quite courageous.)\
\
This crossing filled me with fear, as it was just 11am and water flow was increasing with every hour. So I had to hurry to the Shinkula Pass (16,580ft) and hope that i somehow make the climb up.\
Add to that the clutch not working properly, i was somehow riding in 1st gear at 3k rpm and 8-11 kmph. This was draining the fuel out of the bike and there are obviously no gas stations on such routes.\
\
I was genuinely afraid. Seeing so much water come down like a flood scared me. I didn't know if I would make it to the other side of the pass. But i put my fears aside and decided to just enjoy whatever comes. The views were obviously good, I'd been here 3 days ago.\
\
Reached the bottom of the pass and looked up the dry dirt hairpin turns. I think I can make it up somehow. The decent is tarmac anyway.\
I looked back but couldn't see any other vehicle. Nobody else had passed me after that crazy water crossing. Great! Put all me energy into climbing the steep pass.\
Made it through the first part, and looked back to see the view of the whole valley. Beautiful. And the route looked a little dusty. And i notice a tiny red dot coming in my direction. It's that truck from the morning!!!!!!\
It's far away, but fills me with confidence that there's a backup for me. This driver even offered to drive me and me bike to Manali in the morning, and i had obviously refused. Now it seemed like this would be my saviour in case of soon, which was probably happening soon.\
Started riding a bit further and came across another deep water crossing. Ok i guess this was my limit. Decided to just wait it out for the truck to arrive.\
\
\
The climb up the narrow pass in the truck was so so scary. Felt like it could topple anytime on the bumpy road and I would fall down the hill. Add to that somehow trying to hold the bike up while standing behind in the truck. Next hours hours were nerve wracking but we finally reached Keylong, where they dropped me off and I got the bike repaired. Wasn't much wrong except the clutch that expanded due to heat and needed a simple readjust, and some oil too. (Shame on my engineering degree)\
\
\
Took my last filling up of lamb momos in the night, and 6am the next morning I was on my way home. Good for me, because the official monsoon rainfall started at 4pm the same day.
