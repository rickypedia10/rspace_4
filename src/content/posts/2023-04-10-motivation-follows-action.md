Motivation follows action. The reasoning behind the "action first, motivation second" approach is that once you start working on a task, you start to build momentum and feel a sense of accomplishment, which can motivate you to continue.

Motivation can be elusive and unreliable. Waiting for the "perfect" moment or the "right" level of motivation to strike before starting a task can lead to procrastination and inaction. By taking action first, you can break through that initial barrier and start building momentum, which can then generate motivation and make it easier to continue working.

The "action first, motivation second" approach can be particularly helpful for tasks that feel overwhelming or intimidating. By breaking the task down into smaller, more manageable pieces and committing to taking action, you can start to build confidence and reduce feelings of overwhelm. This, in turn, can generate motivation and make it easier to continue working.
